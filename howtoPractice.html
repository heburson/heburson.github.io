<title> How do I Practice Math?</title>
</head>

<body>
  If you ask most mathematicians, successful students, or professors how to succeed in a college math course such as calculus, one of the first pieces of advice you will get is to practice by doing as many problems as you can find. 
  I strongly agree! However, as a student I found that it took me a long time to figure out how to make the most of the time I spent practicing. And I would get stuck when the problem looked too different from what I had seen before. 
  As an instructor, I quickly learned that I was no where near alone in these struggles. Just like skills such as factoring polynomials and understanding graphical transformations, practicing math is a skill you can learn. 
  However, just like math, learning how to practice is not easy and you might not be good at it right away.

  To help you continue your journey of learning how to efficiently practice mathematics, I will share some advice for what to do when solving a practice problem. This advice is most useful for computational courses, such as calculus, 
  but many of the questions I suggest asking yourself are relevant throughout the undergraduate math curriculum. 
  
  <ol>
    <li> Try to ignore any solutions you may have access to. It is easy to trick yourself into thinking you know how to do something by watching someone else who makes it look easy. 
    <li> After reading the problem, ask yourself the following questions (you might not be able to answer all of them):
      <ul>
        <li> What concepts are involved in this problem? (The list of learning objectives might be helpful here.)
          <li> In what ways is this problem similar to other problems/examples I have seen before?
            <li> In what ways is this problem different from other problems I have seen before?
      </ul>
     <li> Based on your answers to the questions above, try to think of a way to start the problem. (Tip: start with the method(s) used in the problems you thought looked similar). If you are still stuck, 
       look closely at the point where you could no longer apply the method from the earlier problems/examples. What is preventing you from continuing? Can you find an example that would have a similar problem? Can you find a problem you think is similar that you can solve?
       <li> If you still cannot solve the problem, make a plan to attend office hours or post in the discussion board. You now have a lot to say about where you are stuck!
         <li>If you have solved the problem, ask yourself the following questions:
           <ul>
             <li> What is the largest change I could make to this problem without changing the method of solution?
               <li> What is the largest change I could make to this problem without changing the concepts involved? Some ideas:
                 <ul>
                   <li> If the problem involves a function, what if you give less information about the function? What if you define the function by a graph instead of an equation or vice versa.?
                     <li> Can you switch which pieces of information you are given and which pieces you have to find? (e.g. What if instead of having to find the slope of the tangent line at a given point, you have to find the point where the tangent line has a given slope?)
                 </ul>
                 <li> What is the smallest change I could make to this problem such that my previous approach would no longer work?
           </ul>
  </ol>
