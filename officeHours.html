<h3> Q: What are office hours? </h3>
<p> A: Office hours are a time that instructors set aside to be available to students.  They are called "office hours" because, traditionally, 
	students can find the instructor during this time in the instructor's office. However, many instructors choose to hold office hours in another space, 
	like a classroom or library. This semester, my office hours, like all other elements of the course will be held virtually.

<h3> Q: What should I do during office hours?</h3>
<p> A: You have several options of what you can do when you attend office hours.  The most straightforward use of the time is to ask questions about course material or
	assignments.  However, there are many other effective uses of office hours. Here are just a few examples:
	<ul>
		<li> Discuss a concept more in-depth than course time allows for.</li>
		<li> Ask for a solution to a problem from an in-class activity. </li>
		<li> Ask for a hint to get you started on a practice problem. </li>
		<li> Discuss your math background and get help filling in gaps in your knowledge/memory. </li>
