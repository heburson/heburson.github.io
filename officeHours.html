<h3> Q: What are office hours? </h3>
<p> A: Office hours are a time that instructors set aside to be available to students.  They are called "office hours" because, traditionally, 
	students can find the instructor during this time in the instructor's office. However, many instructors choose to hold office hours in another space, 
	like a classroom or library. This semester, my office hours, like all other elements of the course will be held virtually. 
	</p>
<br/>
	
	<h3> Q: Do I need to make an appointment?</h3>
<p> A: Nope! I already plan on being available for anyone who stops by during my office hours.  However, if you are not available during my scheduled office hours or
	you need to meet privately with me about something related to the course (e.g. exam performance or course accommodations), feel free to send me an email to set
	up an appointment for another time. </p>
	<br/>
<h3> Q: What should I do during office hours?</h3>
<p> A: You have several options of what you can do when you attend office hours.  The most straightforward use of the time is to ask questions about course material or
	assignments.  However, there are many other effective uses of office hours. Here are just a few examples:
	<ul>
		<li> Discuss a concept more in-depth than course time allows for.</li>
		<li> Ask for a solution to a problem from an in-class activity. </li>
		<li> Ask for a hint to get you started on a practice problem. </li>
		<li> Discuss your math background and get help filling in gaps in your knowledge/memory. </li>
		<li> Discuss your performance on a past exam/quiz. </li>
	</ul>
	</p> <br/>

<h3> Q: What if I do not have a concrete question, but just feel lost?</h3>
<p> A: Tell me! Math is hard. I promise that you are not the only one who is struggling.  I can ask you questions to help you figure out exactly
	where you stopped following the material. </p> <br/>

<h3> Q: What can I do to prepare for office hours? </h3>
<p> A: First, do not let a lack of preparation keep you from attending office hours. It is better to come with a vague question than to not come at all.
</p> <p>
That said, the most productive conversations usually occur when the student has a clear idea of what concepts they do not understand. To help narrow down your questions, I suggest you try the 
	following things before office hours:
<ul>
	<li> Watch the posted videos and take notes. It is especially helpful to note exactly when you started getting confused.</li>
	<li> Try some example problems. Notice what problems you are able to solve and where you are getting stuck.</li>
	<li> Make a  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_map">concept map</a> to organize your current understanding. </li>
</ul></p> <br/>
