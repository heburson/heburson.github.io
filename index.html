<h1> Welcome! </h1>
<p> I am a mathematics lecturer at the University of Minnesota. I enjoy thinking about innovative and inclusive teaching practices, combinatorics, and number theory. </p>

  <p>I support <a href = "https://fardila.com/" > Prof. Federico Ardila's </a> axioms as foundational to teaching mathematics:
                 <ol>
<li> Mathematical potential is equally present in different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries.</li>
                 <li> Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering mathematical experiences.</li>
                 <li> Mathematics is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their needs.</li>
                 <li> Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect. </li>


                 </ol>
  <p> I did my PhD under  <a href= "http://www.math.uiuc.edu/~berndt/"> Bruce Berndt </a> at the University of Illinois. </p>
