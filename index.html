<h1> Welcome! </h1>
<p> I am a graduating Mathematics Ph.D. student researching combinatorial and additive number theory. I focus on integer partitions and q-series. </p>

  <p> I did my graduate work under  <a href= "http://www.math.uiuc.edu/~berndt/"> Bruce Berndt at the University of Illinois.
  
  <p> In August, I will be starting as a postdoctoral associate at the University of Minnesota. </p>
