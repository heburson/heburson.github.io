 <h1>Teaching Philosophy</h1> 
<p> I believe that everyone is capable of mastering the material covered in the courses I teach. I value questions, persistence, and risk-taking from students. <br/>
	<br/>
Outside of the specific content covered in each course, I find that math courses are a great place to practice the following skills:</p>
<ol>
<li> Breaking a problem into smaller parts.
<li> Organizing and defending an argument. 
<li> Making connections between seemingly disparate topics.
</ol>
